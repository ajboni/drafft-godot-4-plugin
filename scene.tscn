 \"script\": \"<FadeIn()>\\n::Kenji::Hello.\\n::Scorpio:: We need to talk. [serious]\\n::Scorpio::I need someone that can help me with something.\\n::Kenji::Ok....\\n::Scorpio::I know you don't know too much about weapons, but maybe you will be useful with something else.\\n::Scorpio::I need to craft one of the rarest swords that was ever seen on this town.\\n::Kenji:: How do you know I can't craft weapons?\\n::Scorpio::I can just tell that.\\n::Scorpio::The weapon is for me by the way, not a custom offer.\\n::Kenji:: How can I help you?\\n::Scorpio::The sword is not driven by any stone.\\n::Scorpio::It takes power from its owner more than anything.\\n::Kenji::Do you want me to give my life for this sword?\\n::Scorpio::No, no. Nothing extreme like that.\\n::Scorpio::The sword feeds on its owner emotions, not life.\\n::Kenji::I am still not sure how I can help you.\\n::Scorpio::Can you hang out with me?\\n::Kenji::Excuse me?\\n::Scorpio::You heard me right. Can you just hang out with me?\\n::Kenji::I am sure this is  a prank, but I am not sure how to feel about it.\\n::Scorpio::Look, I don't have friends.\\n::Scorpio::The closest person to me is Valerie, but for this sword, I need a male.\\n::Narrator:: Valerie was a common friend of ours, another Goddess.\\n\\n\\n::Scorpio::And here is where you come in.\\n::Kenji::Why me and not someone else?\\n::Scorpio::Because you are the closest to me.\\n::Scorpio::Well, literally.\\n::Scorpio::Also, if you don't do well, I can't fire and then kill you.\\n::Scorpio::Or the other way around.  I will have to decide later.\\n::Kenji::I am not sure the last one makes any sense.\\n::Scorpio::Do you really want to tell a goddess of war, what makes sense and what not?\\n::Kenji::I have no idea what foolish soul said anything in here.\\n::Kenji::I will find him and make sure he pays with his own life.\\n::Scorpio::You should do just that.\\n::Kenji::So, let me see if I understood this right.\\n::Kenji::If I help you, this sword might make you really strong.\\n::Scorpio::That's correct.\\n::Kenji::But if I refuse, I am going to get killed.\\n::Scorpio::That's also correct.\\n::Kenji::Do I have a third option or nah?\\n::Scorpio::Absolutely not.\\n::Kenji::Well, I have a feeling out of nowhere to hang out with you.\\n::Kenji::Please tell me more about you and what your dreams are.\\n::Scorpio::See. It wasn't that tough.\\n::Kenji::You are not the one that will die if they refuse.\\n::Kenji::But seriously now, do we just need to talk?\\n::Kenji::How does this sword work?\\n::Scorpio::I am not quite sure myself.\\n::Scorpio::I already have it but it did nothing for me so far.\\n::Scorpio::I thought maybe I was not strong enough but then I realized.\\n::Scorpio::What if I was looking at it the wrong way all this time?\\n::Scorpio::What if it was another emotion? \\n::Kenji::What could it be?\\n::Scorpio::Love.\\n::Kenji::Eh? Are you serious?\\n::Scorpio::A lot of mystical weapons have been hidden from people.\\n::Scorpio::Most of them have a love story behind them.\\n::Scorpio::Think about it.\\n::Scorpio::People started wars because of love, people killed others because of love and people betrayed because of love.\\n::Kenji::I don't think that's quite right.\\n::Kenji::People did all those things because of jealousy, not love.\\n::Scorpio::I found them to be strongly connected with each other.\\n::Kenji::That might be true, but even then, do you need to experience love or jealousy?\\n::Scorpio::Again, I will probably experience both but I think love is the key.\\n::Scorpio::Don't look at me like that. I realize how stupid I sound.\\n::Scorpio::I tried everything else though and I need this sword.\\n::Kenji::Fine, fine. I will help you.\\n::Kenji::What should we do now?\\n::Scorpio::No idea. I was never in love as you can tell and never cared about other guys.\\n::Scorpio::I just wanted to fight my whole life. For an eternity I was only interested about wars and fights.\\n::Kenji::We should probably start with knowing more about each other.\\n::Kenji::What do you like to do?\\n::Scorpio::Start wars and kill others for their stupidity.\\n::Kenji::Maybe something more romantic than that?\\n::Kenji::Walks on the beach?\\n::Scorpio::Only if we need to fight there.\\n::Kenji::Just spending time with someone really close? Maybe hugging them?\\n::Scorpio::The only people that I hug are the death ones when I needed to hide from deadly arrows.\\n::Kenji::Aha.\\n::Kenji::Maybe your favorite drink or food.\\n::Kenji::Please don't even answer that. I assume it will be the blood and tears of your enemies.\\n::Scorpio::Heyyy! I think we are getting to know each other more than we thought.\\n::Kenji::Yes. I am not worried about it at all.\\n::Scorpio::Is this working already? Let me check.\\n::Scorpio::Unfortunately the sword is not responding.\\n::Kenji::What should even happen?\\n::Scorpio::The color should change and I will feel a lot of power going through me.\\n::Kenji::That is something I would love to see.\\n::Kenji::If that's all you needed help with, can I go now?\\n::Scorpio::I suppose so, but we need to meet again too.\\n::Scorpio::This clearly wasn't enough for the sword.\\n\"
